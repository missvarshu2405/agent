1. Title & Overview
Life Automation Supervisor (LAS) – Personal Executive Assistant

LAS is a code-driven, multi-agent personal assistant designed to manage an entire user’s week. The system orchestrates a set of specialized agents to automate planning, tracking, and reminders for daily life tasks, transforming scattered inputs into actionable and organized outputs.

2. Project Overview – LAS
Supervisor-Controlled Multi-Agent Life Automation

LAS implements a supervisor-led orchestration pipeline. Each agent handles a specific life domain—meal planning, travel, finances, wellness—while the supervisor validates outputs and manages execution order. The system ensures each action aligns with user preferences and context stored in memory, creating a seamless, personalized experience.

3. Problem Statement
Limitations of Manual Life Management

Managing meals, schedules, travel, expenses, and wellness separately is repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming. Existing tools often handle only one domain and lack holistic integration, leaving users to coordinate multiple apps manually.

4. Solution Statement
Integrated Multi-Agent Automation with Persistent Memory

LAS solves this by assigning each life domain to a specialized agent. A central supervisor coordinates agents, enforces validation checks, and integrates outputs into a coherent, actionable plan. Persistent memory ensures the system adapts to individual preferences over time, enhancing relevance and efficiency.

5. Architecture
Supervisor–Agent Model with Utility and API Integration

The architecture includes:

Supervisor Agent: Orchestrates execution order, validates outputs, and handles inter-agent communication (A2A).

Domain-Specific Agents: Each agent focuses on a single life domain with specialized logic.

Memory Agent: Stores personal preferences, previous plans, and recurring data.

External API Utilities: Integrates real-time data such as maps, grocery prices, and travel options.

Validation Utilities: Ensures each output is complete, consistent, and actionable.

This modular design allows parallel or sequential execution depending on dependencies, with support for long-running loops.

6. Agents & Their Roles
Direct Mapping to Code-Defined Agents

Calendar Agent: Reads user schedules, identifies free slots, and provides time windows for other agents to plan around.

Meal Planner Agent: Creates 7-day nutritious meal plans based on preferences and dietary constraints.

Grocery Agent: Generates shopping lists, checks prices via external APIs, and optimizes purchase planning.

Travel Planner Agent: Compares transportation options (flights, trains, cabs) using OpenAPI tools for efficient travel planning.

Finance Tracker Agent: Analyzes expenses, categorizes spending, and provides summarized financial insights.

Wellness Agent: Sends reminders, tracks habits, and manages wellness goals.

Memory Agent: Maintains user preferences, recurring tasks, and historical data for personalized automation.

7. Key Features

Sequential + Parallel Execution: Optimizes agent workflow based on dependencies.

OpenAPI Integration: Retrieves real-time data for travel, grocery, and scheduling.

Persistent Memory: Adapts outputs based on user behavior over time.

A2A Communication: Agents can share data and trigger workflows dynamically.

Long-Running Loops: Supports ongoing monitoring and updates without restarting.

8. Conclusion
Practical Implementation of Life Automation

LAS showcases how multi-agent architectures can automate complex real-life workflows. By integrating planning, tracking, and reminders into one system, it replaces fragmented manual management with a reliable, personalized executive assistant.

9. Value Statement
Why This Project Matters

LAS demonstrates innovation beyond single-domain automation apps. It combines modular agent design, persistent memory, and API-driven intelligence to create a real-world personal assistant capable of managing an entire week efficiently.
